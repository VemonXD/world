          <h1>Plague Doctor</h1>
            <h2>What did the doctors do in the plague?</h2>
                <p>Bloodletting and other remedies, such as putting frogs or leeches on the buboes to "rebalance the humors," were used by plague doctors. Apart from treating plague patients, a plague doctor's main responsibility was to compile public records of plague deaths. </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Why did plague doctors carry sticks?</h2>
                <p>Their profession was indicated by a wide-brimmed leather hat, and they used wooden canes to point out areas that needed attention and to examine patients without touching them. The canes were also used to keep people away from plague victims and to remove their clothing without having to touch them.</p>
                <br>
            <h2>Why did the plague doctor wear a beak?</h2>
                <p>Plague doctors wore a mask with a bird-like beak to protect them from being infected by deadly diseases such as the Black Death, which they believed was airborne. In fact, they thought disease was spread by miasma, a noxious form of 'bad air. The beak could hold dried flowers, herbs, camphor, and a abundance of other things.</p>
                <br> 
            <h2>Who is the most famous plague doctor?</h2>
                <p>Nostradamus, the most famous plague doctor; he advised people to remove infected bodies, get some fresh air, drink clean water, drink rose hip juice, and not bleed the patient.</p>
                <br>

                <p class = 'paragraph' style= 'margin-right: 850px'> The clothing worn by plague doctors was intended to protect them from airborne diseases during outbreaks of the Bubonic Plague in Europe.</p>

                    De Lorme thought the beak shape of the mask would give the air sufficient time to be suffused by the protective herbs before it hit plague doctors' nostrils and lungs.</p>
